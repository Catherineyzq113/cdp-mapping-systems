# cdp-mapping-systems
repo for CDP Mapping Systems summer course

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new Python environment. I recommend using [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for this, but you can also use virtualenv. This will protect our system Python installation from any changes we make.
   1. If you're using Conda, you can create a new environment with the following command:
      ```
      conda create -n [pick-a-name] python=3.11
      ```
